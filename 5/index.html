    <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
            This project works with diffusions models to generate various interesting images with various techniques such as CFG, Anagram generation, and Hybrid images. In part a, we use the Claude Diffusion model from HuggingFace. In part b, we train my own diffusion model to generate MINST digits. 
        </p>

    <h2>Part A</h2>
<h4>Part 1.1: Implementing the Forward Process </h4>
<p>
    In this section we are noising clean image such that the diffusion model can be trained to denoise them. In this section and following sections, we will be using a photo of the campanile as an clean example image to experiment with. 

The campanile will be x_0, the clean image at time 0. At time t, the noised image will be solved for according to

      <p>
          Let's see the output of noising. Below are the images we are working with. On the left, is the clean orignial campanile image. To its right, we have the campanile noised at steps 250, 500, and 750.
