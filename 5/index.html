    <h1>Welcome to My CS180 Project 5!</h1>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
            This project works with diffusions models to generate various interesting images with various techniques such as CFG, Anagram generation, and Hybrid images. In part a, we use the Claude Diffusion model from HuggingFace. In part b, we train my own diffusion model to generate MINST digits. 
        </p>

    <h2>Part A</h2>
<h4>Part 1.1: Implementing the Forward Process </h4>
<p>
    In this section we are noising clean image such that the diffusion model can be trained to denoise them. In this section and following sections, we will be using a photo of the campanile as an clean example image to experiment with. 

The campanile will be x_0, the clean image at time 0. At time t, the noised image will be solved for according to
</p>

    </figure>
</div>

      <p>
          Let's see the output of noising. Below are the images we are working with. On the left, is the clean orignial campanile image. To its right, we have the campanile noised at steps 250, 500, and 750.

              <figcaption>Noised Images at t = 250, 500, 750</figcaption>
          </figure>
      </div>
      
<h4>Part 1.2: Attempting Classical Denoising</h4>
    <p>
        We know various methods for denoising Gaussian Noise. One such method that we know is Guassian Blurring the noisy images. Lets see how Guassian Blurring handles this noise. 
    </p>

      <div class = "row">
        <figure>
            <img src = "media/classicDenoised15.jpg">
            <figcaption>Noisy images at t = 250, 500, 750 Denoised with Guassian Blur</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p>
          As we can see, Guassian Blurring is unable to denoise the images satisfactorily. In fact, Gaussian Blurring will deliver poor denoising in this situation for any parameter values.
      </p>

      <h4>Part 1.3: One Step Denoising</h4>
      <p>
          Now, we will try a more sophisticated method to denoise the images. We will use the Claude Diffusion model from HuggingFace that has been trained for these alpha values. Claude uses text embedding; we will use the prompt "a high quality photo" as instructions to denoise the images. We will be using one step denoising where we call the UNet at the t value used to noise the images to estimate the x_0 clean image. Let's see how the UNet does.

                Columns are as follows: Original Image, Noisy Image, Noise Estimate, DeNoised Image
